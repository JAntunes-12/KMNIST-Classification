# KMNIST-Classification

This is a repository to store the solution to the classification problem of the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset. This is a project developed for the "Hands-On Tutorial on AI" promoted by INESC-TEC and taught by Professor José Carlos Principe.

This solution entails two major courses of action. One based on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and another based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
